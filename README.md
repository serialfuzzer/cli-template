# cli-template
This is my template that I use to create Node.js based CLI apps. It's highly based on commander. You could copy it and use it  for your projects


# Usage

1. Run `$bash make.sh nameofyourtool`
2. Add your custom code
3. `Run $ sudo npm install . `
4. You will be able to use your tool using `$ nameofyourtool`
